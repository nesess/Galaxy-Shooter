Info:

Although I generally followed the course, I made changes. Such as a complete and better spawner system. With enemy spawner, spawn rate is increases as time goes. With Asteroid spawner, asteroids have chance to spawn different locations. This changes increases game difficulty so make game aim to get highest score. Also, I made  game theme color changer system with this game color theme chance continuously. I think this is very cool addition.

I can share game files if requested.
